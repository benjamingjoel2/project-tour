/**
 * Shared boilerplate blocks for the destination-page "End-to-End Services"
 * and "Projectour Guarantee" sections. Ported verbatim from
 * hyperporter-3.html's SERVICES / GUARANTEE constants — identical copy on
 * every destination page except for the `{C}` country-name substitution
 * in GUARANTEE. That sameness is the thin-content problem flagged
 * separately (see the migration plan); porting it unchanged here is a
 * faithful copy of the prototype, not a fix for it.
