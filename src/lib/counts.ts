/**
 * Single source of truth for how many countries and regions the network

 * Before this, "130+" was hard-coded into page copy and meta descriptions
 * while the homepage said 137 — two different numbers live on the same
 * site. Every page now derives the figure, so it cannot drift again: add or
 * remove a destination entry and the whole site follows.
 *
 * The public figure is still an open question (a founder brief said
 * "100+"); this at least guarantees one answer everywhere.
